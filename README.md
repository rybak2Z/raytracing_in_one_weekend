This is my multithreaded ðŸš€blazingly fastðŸš€ (not really) Rust implementation of Peter Shirley's 
[Raytracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#metal) tutorial/book.

Use with `cargo run -r > image.ppm`

~~Here is an example image that I rendered in only 1h40m ðŸ”¥~~ Turns out I'm dumb and forgot to run it in release mode. That way it took 28 minutes.
